Laboratory work is a compulsory part of the programme. The academic content has been chosen in order to infuse passion for excellence in the learners and the teachers. Every student is subject to a process of continuous evaluation comprising periodic assignments, quizzes, presentations, group discussions, and of course written examinations. We believe that this comprehensive approach can really motivate the student to strive for cultivation of knowledge with the professional career coming as a by-product.
